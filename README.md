### Oh, hello there.
I'm Abeer. 

I'm a technoloy leader. I specialize in Platform Engineering & DevOps transformation. I aim to enable faster, more efficient software development and delivery through self-service infrastructure and standardized processes, while ensuring quality is baked in. Nothing gives me more joy than empowering high-performing teams who then can go out and build great products and platforms that drive innovation and impact, and achieve business outcome. 

I leverage Github for learning, prototyping & testing out architectural & infrastructure patterns to validate ideas & concepts, and usually implement them at scale in the organizations I work at.
